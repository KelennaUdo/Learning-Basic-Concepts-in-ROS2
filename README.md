# Learning-Basic-Concepts-in-ROS2
This repository documents my hands-on learning of ROS 2 (Jazzy) fundamentals through structured tutorials and exercises. It contains small, focused examples covering core ROS 2 concepts such as nodes, topics, services, custom interfaces, parameters, and basic system organization, implemented primarily in Python and C++.
The work follows along with and extends material from:

- ROS 2 for Beginners (ROS Jazzy – 2025) (Udemy)

- Introduction to ROS (DigiKey YouTube playlist)

The goal of this repository is to demonstrate progressive understanding of ROS 2 concepts through clean, well-organized code, while serving as a personal reference and portfolio of foundational robotics software skills.
